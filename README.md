# Proof of Concept for Merging XFDF Annotations into PDFs

When you execute the test, it complains like this:

`com.itextpdf.forms.xfdf.XfdfReader       : Xfdf no f object to compare.`

## What I want

Integrate the annotations from the XFDF file into the original PDF file resulting in an output PDF file again.
